# QA401 Web

Simple web interface for usage with the [REST API](https://github.com/QuantAsylum/QA401H) for the [QA401 Audio Analyzer](https://quantasylum.com/products/qa401-audio-analyzer). This allows a visual interface on Linux.

Due to missing CORS-headers in the REST API it will not work by default. I currently use a [proxy](https://github.com/Shivam010/bypass-cors/) as a workaround.
